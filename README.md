This project provides a customizable, animated accordion component built with Bootstrap 5 and enhanced with CSS animations.

## Getting Started

1. Download the `accordion.html` file.
2. Include it in your project.

## Usage

The component relies on the following CDN links:

### Bootstrap 5 CSS & JS

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha3/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css"
/>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.3.0-alpha3/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script>
```

### Glyphicons CSS

```html
<link
  rel="stylesheet"
  href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/glyphicons-css@1.1.0/template.min.css"
/>
```

Include these in the `<head>` section of your HTML file, and the Bootstrap JS bundle before the closing `</body>` tag.

## Customization

### Icon Classes

The accordion buttons use Glyphicons classes:

- Default (closed): `glyphicons glyphicons-plus-sign`
- Open state: `glyphicons glyphicons-minus-sign`

You can adjust these classes to use different icons from the Glyphicons library.

### Color and Animation

The CSS in this component controls all colors, animations, and layout properties. You can customize:

- Button background and text colors
- Icon transformation and rotation (using CSS transitions and cubic-bezier easing)
- Content animations (open/close effects) defined in the keyframes

### Structure

Modify or extend the accordion by adding more `.accordion-item` blocks. The structure follows Bootstrap's accordion guidelines.
